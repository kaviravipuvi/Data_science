""" unimodal- one local minima
 all differentiable are always continuous
continuous = sin, cos,
non continuous= step function, 

J'= slope or tangent at a point or rate of change of J
J""= rate of change of J'

Golden section method - powerfull method - self study- region elimination approaches

numerical methods are very prone to intial guess

HW: why min lies between w1 and w3?

why not between w1 and w2 or w2 and w3?
